## Homework#2 Automate Your Day Job with Python

This is the first assignment that I was using the concepts I've learned to complete **two** Python activities, PyBank and PyRamen. 
Both activities present a real-world situation in which my Python skills came in handy. 


## PyBank

In this activity, I were tasked with creating a Python-Pandas script for analyzing the financial records of my company. I was provided with a financial dataset in this file: [budget_data.csv](PyBank/budget_data.csv). This dataset was composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

My task was to create a Python-Pandas script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
